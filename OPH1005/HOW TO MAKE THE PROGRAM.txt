_____________________ Making the Load File _____________

From a command prompt type:

m <name of the program, e.g. myprogram>

When running this for the demo program, just type:

m 

This will run the m.bat file, which will run the make.exe command, which will create the program, using the sources in the sources folder etc.

To clean up the directory type:

m clean

_______________________ Load File ___________

As a result of the make command (with m.bat), a new file is created with a .hex extension (e.g. XFP3092F.hex). This is the so-called Load File. This file needs to be uploaded to the bar code scanner with the program called Appload.exe

Start the program Appload.exe (C:\Program Files (x86)\Appload\appload.exe).
From the 'File' menu choose 'Download. A window will open to browse for the Opticon firmware file to download to the handheld terminal. Fro example, choose a demo firmware application file called XFP3092E.hex. A progress indicator will show as well as a notification on the handheld Terminal stating 'Load software'. Once the loading has completed, a pop-up window on the computer will state 'Download successfully completed'.

Choose the menu 'Version' on the handheld Terminal to verify if the firmware application has been successfully installed (e.g. Software Version # XFM3092E).
